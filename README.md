# Steven Volckaert's Enterprise Library

**Steven Volckaert's Enterprise Library** is a collection of .NET *class libraries* that contain reusable software
components designed to assist software developers with writing less and semantically more meaningful code.

In practice, the class libraries extend on types available in the various namespaces of the
[Framework Class Library (FCL)][1] (CoreFX for the .NET Standard 1.5 target). Therefore, it contains no
application-specific code and has no depencencies to third-party .NET libraries or frameworks.

## NuGet

Enterprise Library will be available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) later.
